I. install required sw
	Neo4j - https://neo4j.com/download-v2/
	python libraries (requires neo4j, json /built-in/, datetime /built-in/)
		neo4j - pip install neo4j

IIa. create new database 
	it can be done in Neo4j Desktop app
	the password for database need to be "admin" (or different password need to be edited in the script)

IIb. clear existing database
	with this command in Neo4j Desktop console:
	MATCH (p) DETACH DELETE p 

III. run the python script 'import_tool.py'
	this script will import the data from coronavirus data in json (data.json)
	this json does not include names of districts so the names and codes are in separe file (districts_names_codes.json)
	negborows - the relations between districs - are in another file (districts_negborows_relations.json)
	in the end the script will query all dates and add relations between all dates for the same discrtrits

IV. database is ready
	if you want to import data again you need to clear the database before with command from step IIb.

some query examples:
	graph of districs in one day '2020-09-09'
		MATCH (a:District) WHERE a.date='2020-09-09' RETURN a

	graph of districs in two days '2020-09-09' and '2020-09-10'
		MATCH (a:District), (b:District) WHERE a.date='2020-09-10' AND b.date='2020-09-09' RETURN a,b

	graph of all dates for one district 'Brno-město'
		MATCH (a:District) WHERE a.name='Brno-město' RETURN a

	graph of range of days from '2020-09-01' to '2020-09-30' for one district 'Znojmo'
		MATCH (a:District) WHERE a.name='Znojmo' AND a.date >= '2020-09-01' AND a.date <= '2020-09-30' RETURN a

	table of date and daily increase number of infected people in district 'Brno-venkov' for all dates
		MATCH (a:District) WHERE a.name='Brno-venkov' RETURN a.date, a.incInf
